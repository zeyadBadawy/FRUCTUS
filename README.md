# FRUCTUS
The main goal of this project

## 1: Develop a unique Onboarding screen ##
Create a fully-featured iOS Onboarding screen with the new Page Tab View capability provided by the updated SwiftUI
## 2: Create a List and Details view ##
Get familiar with scroll view, horizontal view, vertical view containers and list and display multiple Views automatically with ForEach loop
## 3: Create an outstanding Settings view ##
Every outstanding app needs to have a well designed and thoughtful structure. This iOS 14 application is no exception from that.
Users if they want, now they can restart the application by toggle the switch in the Settings screen. 
That way the app starts the onboarding process and we will see the welcome screen again.
